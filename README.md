# Py-NAT
PyNAT is an Python based Naval Architecture tool.

It can compute
	Hydrostatics at even keel and trim
	Cross curves of stability (KN Curves)
	GZ curves at a given Load Cases (i.e., Mass and VCG)

Note that no installation is required. The application comes in an executable, that only reads, computes and writes data to its parent directory.

A preliminary validation showed reasonable accuracy. One can experiment with the code and improve the speed and accuracy by changing the type of curve fit and integration techniques implemented in python.

The Git HuB Repository contains the following :
	1. The Python Source Script
	2. The Application "PyNAT.exe"
	3. User Guide and Demo video
	4. Test Cases on KVLCC2
